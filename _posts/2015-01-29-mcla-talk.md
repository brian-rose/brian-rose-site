I gave an invited public lecture on the fundamental science of climate change at the [Massachusetts College of Liberal Arts](www.mcla.edu): **"What Sets the Temperature of the Earth?"**.
This was part of MCLAâ€™s [Green Living Seminar Series](http://www.mcla.edu/About_MCLA/area/Community-Collaborations/berkshireenvironmentalresourcecenter/greenlivingseminars/). A podcast of my talk is available [here](http://www.mcla.edu/Assets/MCLA-Files/About-MCLA/Area/GreenLiving/Pod-Casts/What%20sets%20the%20temperature%20of%20the%20Earth%202015-1-29%2064bitmono.mp3).
