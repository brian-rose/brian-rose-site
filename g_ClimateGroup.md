This is an informal group of faculty, graduate students and postdocs from DAES and ASRC with research interests in climate. We meet regularly throughout the academic year for research presentations and discussion.

The schedule will be posted here, and also distributed through our email list:

If you would like to be added to the list, just let me (Brian Rose) know.

Meeting time and place (usually whenever classes are in session): Fridays 9:15 - 10:15 am, room ES 328
