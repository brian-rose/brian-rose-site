# Teaching

Here's a list of all the courses I've taught since starting at UAlbany in Fall 2013.
Links to legacy webpages for previous versions of each course are provided below.

## Atmospheric Thermodynamics (AATM 320)

Core undergraduate course in the ATM major. 
The goal of this course is to understand the physical laws that govern how energy and heat are transmitted in the atmosphere.

[Fall 2024](https://brian-rose.github.io/atm320-thermodynamics/), [Fall 2023](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/atm320-thermodynamics/2023/)

## General Circulation of the Atmosphere (AATM 622)

A hands-on, data-centric approach (work in progress).

[Fall 2022](https://brian-rose.github.io/general-circulation/home.html)

## Atmospheric Dynamics (AATM 500)

Core graduate course on the fundamentals of geophysical fluid dynamics and large-scale atmospheric motions.

[Fall 2021](http://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2021),
Fall 2020 *(course temporarily moved to the Blackboard platform, taught in hybrid synchronous simulcast mode)*,
[Fall 2019](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2019),
[Fall 2018](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2018),
[Fall 2017](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2017),
[Fall 2016](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2016),
[Fall 2015](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM500_Fall2015)


## Climate Laboratory (AENV 415 / AATM 415)

A hands-on course in climate modeling. Learn about climate science by building and using models.
Open to students in the ATM and ENV programs (typically in junior or senior year). Offered every second Spring semester.

Since 2020, this course uses my interactive textbook
[The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/). All course content is freely available and permissively licensed through this book ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

As of 2024, I'm using an access-controlled Brightspace page to manage class schedules, assignments, and announcements.

[Spring 2022](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2022/),
[Spring 2020](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2020/),
[Spring 2018](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2018/),
[Spring 2016](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV415_Spring2016/),
[Spring 2014](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ENV480_Spring2014/)

*Note that the Spring 2020 version is incomplete because the course moved to Blackboard midway through the semester due to the COVID-19 shutdown.*

## Climate Modeling (AATM 623)

Advanced graduate course in the theory and practice of modeling the climate system and climate processes.
My interactive textbook [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/)
was developed through several iterations of teaching this course
and the undergraduate Climate Laboratory course.

[Spring 2019](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2019),
[Spring 2017](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2017),
[Spring 2015](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM623_Spring2015)

## The Atmosphere (AATM 100)

An introduction to the essential processes acting in the Earthâ€™s atmosphere for non-majors.
AATM 100 is an approved Natural Science course in the [UAlbany General Education Program](https://www.albany.edu/undergraduate_bulletin/general_education.html).

Spring 2021: fully online/asynchronous course on Blackboard

## Dynamic Meteorology I (AATM 316)

Core undergraduate course on the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric motions.

[Fall 2014](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM316_Fall2014/)

## Oceans and Climate Seminar (AATM 619)

A graduate seminar on the fundamental of ocean circulation and its effects on the climate system.

[Fall 2013](https://www.atmos.albany.edu/facstaff/brose/classes/ATM619_Fall2013/)
