# Brian Rose
Our fearless leader. Assistant Professor in the [Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences](http://www.albany.edu/atmos/index.php) at the [University at Albany](http://www.albany.edu).

I joined [DAES](http://www.albany.edu/atmos/index.php) in Fall 2013. Previously I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, hosted by [David S. Battisti](http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~david/). I completed my PhD in 2010 in the [Program in Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate](http://eaps-www.mit.edu/paoc/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/).  My thesis advisor was [John Marshall](http://eaps-www.mit.edu/paoc/people/john-marshall). I first came to UW as a visiting scholar under the [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/cgc/index.html).

# Lance Rayborn
Hello! I am Ph.D. student working with Dr. Brian Rose in the Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences at the University at Albany. I graduated summa cum laude with a B.S. in Research Meteorology and a Minor in Mathematics from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in 2013. 

My research interests include climate variability/dynamics, ocean/atmosphere interactions and aerosol/pollution effects on our climate system. Currently, I am working on understanding the effects of ocean heat uptake on cloud feedback as our climate warms. 
Feel free to contact me at <lrayborn@albany.edu>.
