## Brian Rose
Assistant Professor in the [Department of Atmospheric and Environmental Sciences](http://www.albany.edu/atmos/index.php) at the [University at Albany](http://www.albany.edu).

I joined DAES in Fall 2013. Previously I was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington, hosted by [David S. Battisti](http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~david/). I completed my PhD in 2010 in the [Program in Atmospheres, Oceans and Climate](http://eaps-www.mit.edu/paoc/) at [MIT](http://www.mit.edu/).  My thesis advisor was [John Marshall](http://eaps-www.mit.edu/paoc/people/john-marshall). I first came to UW as a visiting scholar under the [NOAA Climate and Global Change Postdoctoral Fellowship](http://www.vsp.ucar.edu/cgc/index.html).
