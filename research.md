# Research

## Overview

I am broadly interested in the behavior of the climate system at the global scale.
Our group's research is oriented toward fundamental questions such as:

- What factors control the global mean temperature and its equator-to-pole gradient?
- What determines the rate of global warming, land-ocean contrasts, and polar amplification?
- Why has Earth's climate been more variable during some periods of the deep geological past than others?
- Is the climate unique, or does the Earth system possess multiple equilibria?

By studying the fundamental underlying rules governing the climate system, we build a deeper understanding of the past and future evolution of climate on Earth, and other planets as well.

## Background

Attempting to answer the above questions inevitably involves studying the often-surprising interactions among different components of the climate system: atmosphere, ocean, ice, etc. I have broad training in both atmospheric science and oceanography, and I am particularly interested in coupled atmosphere-ocean climate dynamics over long time scales. I also have special interests in polar climate, ocean-sea ice interaction, and radiative feedback processes.
In recent years I have also become very passionate about open, reproducible science,
and the crucial role of technology and software in that process.
I encourage my students to pursue a broad graduate education that aligns with their own interests.

## Philosophy, approach, and tools

Our group's work typically takes a *building blocks* approach, trying to build understanding of the complex climate system through judicious simplification. We explore ideas using hierarchies of idealized atmosphere-ocean models, ranging from simple mathematical descriptions to complex coupled numerical calculations.

Our day-to-day work rests upon these **three pillars**:

- **Curiosity**: Science is ultimately about the fun of asking questions and seeking answers.
Remembering to follow your curiosity is a serious business.
- **Rigor**: We can't answer questions without striving to answer question well!
We aim to be careful, thoughtful, and quantitative in all our work,
and communicate our results are clearly as possible.
- **Openness and reproducibility**: Science is also fundamentally about communication.
Given the central role of computation in our field, we have a special responsibility to
guard against the proliferation of non-reproducible results.
We embrace [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) as a core value,
and we put time and effort into developing tools that serve the scientific community.

Some **specific tools** we work with:
- Numerical climate models such as the [Community Earth System Model (CESM)](http://www.cesm.ucar.edu) and the [MITgcm](http://mitgcm.org)
- [climlab](https://climlab.readthedocs.io), a flexible Python-based toolkit for building model hierarchies (developed right here in our group but used worldwide!)
- Atmospheric reanalysis data products such as the [MERRA-2](https://gmao.gsfc.nasa.gov/reanalysis/MERRA-2/) from NASA.
- Python and Jupyter notebooks for most of our day-to-day analysis work.
- Good old-fashioned pencil and paper!



## Current projects

Some specific ongoing research interests and projects include:

- Effects of ocean heat uptake, natural variability, and pattern effects on climate sensitivity and radiative feedback processes
- Understanding the land-atmosphere processes controlling desert amplification
- The observed vertical structure of heat fluxes into the Arctic and their role in polar amplification
- Multiple equilibria in the coupled climate system
- The dynamics of past warm climates and glacial-interglacial transitions
- Oceanography of Snowball Earth
- [Effects of obliquity on exoplanet climate](posts/2017/2017-08-04-ice-belt-paper-accepted)
