# climlab: the Climate Laboratory project

Brian is the lead PI and developer of the [climlab software package](http://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and the online interactive textbook [The Climate Laboratory](https://brian-rose.github.io/ClimateLaboratoryBook/)

## climlab: a Python-based toolbox for process-oriented climate modeling

My code is now hosted on github: <https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab.git>

This is a growing project, funded through my NSF CAREER award and connected to my undergraduate course [A ATM / A ENV 415 Climate Laboratory]({{ site.baseurl }}/classes/ENV415_Spring2018), and my graduate course [A ATM 623 Climate Modeling]({{ site.baseurl }}/clases/ATM623_Spring2017).

A bunch of `climlab`-related resources:

- The [source code on github](https://github.com/brian-rose/climlab)
- The [online documentation](http://climlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- Lecture notes for ATM 623: Climate Modeling in Jupyter notebook format:
  - [Notebooks hosted on github](https://github.com/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware)
  - [Rendered as static web pages](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/blob/master/index.ipynb) (using nbviewer)
  - [Run interactively in the cloud!](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/brian-rose/ClimateModeling_courseware/master) (using Binder)
