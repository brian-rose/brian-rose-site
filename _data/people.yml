      bio: >
        Fearless leader of the Rose research group!
        I'm passionate about science, education, math, the Earth,
        open-source software, bicycles, building communities,
        music (stringed instruments especially),
        food, drink, and family. When I'm not working, I'm basically a hobbit.

        I am enthusiastic about climate science in general.
        My research interests include multiple equilibria in the coupled climate
        system and causes of glacial-interglacial cycles.
        Using a hierarchy of climate models and the theories of nonlinear
        dynamical systems, my goal is to understand how every component of the
        climate system has worked together to produce the large climatic
        transitions in the Earth’s history.
        When I’m not working, I enjoy reading, walking, violin and clouds.
